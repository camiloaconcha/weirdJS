Conceptual Aside 
-Syntax Parsers
-Execution Context 
-Lexical Environments

Name / Value Pair :

Object:
-Object is a colection of Value Pairs

The Global Environment and the global object:
-The global Object in the browsers is the window
    Global Object = this 
-Given the avobe 

-Global:not inside a function
-Execution context : 
-Outer Environment

The Execution context Creation and 'Hoisting': 

-Hoisting is when a variable is in the dom but it can be undefined
 if is a function it shares the value of.

- The Execution context is created in two phases 
    -First is called 'the creation phase'
        -This phase creates:global object, this and outer environment.
        -Setup Memory Space for variables and functions "Hoisting".
        -variables are only saved in memory but not its value , functions are 
         totally in memory , thats the reason why the function console log prints the value 
         but not the variable .
    -Execution phase

Javascript and 'undefined':
In the concept of Hoisting the variables declared are equal to 'undefined' and the undeclared are 'not defined'
-undefined means that the variable hasnt been set but the value undefined is in javascript a value not a String in quotes 

The Execution context: Code Execution
It runs your: Global Object, this , Outer Environment.
-RUNS CODE-
